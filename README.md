# Ojective
- The objective of this programming assignment is to explore and utilize the diffent tools and commands that Python has to offer.

# Procedure
### o For the first problem I was required to make a function to sort a word/words alphabetically. So in order to sort the given word alphabetically, I used the function "sorted()". This function would sort the word in accending order basing on ASCII Table. Then using ".join" the letters would not be printed as individual elements but as one line of letters with no spacing.

### o For the second problem I was required to create a program that would detect the words "smile", "mad", "grin", and "sad" and turn it to its emoticon version. So first I made a dictionary for the emoticons so that I can use it later. Then using the ".split" in order to turn my string to a list. Then using a for loop in which it would try to read the word if it is one of the words in the emoticon dictionary. Once the loop detects a word it would replace the word with the emoticon that is paired to the word. Then the function would return the sentence with the emoticon.

### o For the last problem I was required to create a program that would outupt the first, middle and, last elements of a set. For this program I first made set with my own elements then using the code "first, *middle, last". Then I printed it out with a format of "First:  Middle:  Last:" with its elemets as its outputs.

# Conclusion

- After completing this programming assignment, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively utilize the various tools and libraries that Python offers. Throughout the process, I learned not only the syntax and structure of the language but also how to apply built-in functions, modules, and external libraries to solve specific problems. This experience allowed me to practice breaking down a task into smaller steps, choosing the appropriate Python features for each part, and integrating them to achieve the desired outcome. Overall, the assignment enhanced my problem-solving skills and gave me more confidence in applying Python to real-world scenarios.
